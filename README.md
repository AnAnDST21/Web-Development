# Web-Development
In this Repository I am going to upload all my web development project. In making of these project I used HTML, CSS  and Javascript etc. I making of these projects I leaned many new things.  

#Landing Page

This is my Lading Page and while creating this page I use Bootstrap for creating Navigation Bar and I fix its poistion and also made it responsive.
I also used many other keywords such as Hover for to change the color of icon. I also use Div.

<img src= "./Landing Page.png" width=600 height=300>

While creating this part I mainly use Position but I also use z-index 

<img src="./Landing Page 2.png" width=600 height=300>

<img src="./Landing Page 3.png" width=800 height=300>

For creating this I use Div for and Bootstrap most exciting thing Carousel and for adjusting images size I use max-width and position and I also use text generator named Loren Ipsum.
